# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors – Python Game

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **text-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game** implemented using **Python**.  
The user plays against the computer, which makes its choice randomly. The program then evaluates both choices and declares the result based on predefined rules.

The project focuses on **conditional logic, randomness, and user input handling**, which are core programming concepts required for building interactive systems.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

I built this project to understand how **random behavior and rule-based decision logic** can be implemented in Python.  
By simulating a computer opponent using randomness, this project helped me explore how programs can make non-deterministic decisions — a key idea behind simulations and basic AI behavior.

The project also strengthened my ability to translate **real-world game rules into executable logic**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
    
- Random number generation using Python’s `random` module
    
- User input handling and validation
    
- Rule-based decision making
    
- Lists and indexing
    
- Writing clean, readable Python code

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Use randomness to simulate computer decisions
    
- Implement rule-based logic using conditional statements
    
- Handle and validate user input effectively
    
- Structure small Python programs cleanly
    
- Translate game mechanics into code logic

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add input validation loops to prevent crashes
    
- Implement score tracking across multiple rounds
    
- Convert logic into reusable functions
    
- Add a replay option
    
- Extend the rule engine to support more choices (e.g., Rock–Paper–Scissors–Lizard–Spock)
